Create `examples/config.schema.json`\n- Define schema for all config sections: storage, model, whisper, server, dictation, hotkeys, subs\n- Include proper types, descriptions, defaults, and enums where applicable\n- Use JSON Schema draft-07 format\n\n### 2. Move config file\n- Move `config/config.toml` to `examples/config.toml` (standard location for byteowlz projects)\n\n### 3. Add schema reference to config.toml\nAt the top of the config file, add:\n```toml\n\"\\$schema\" = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/byteowlz/schemas/refs/heads/main/eaRS/eaRS.config.schema.json\"\n```\n\n### 4. Sync schema to central repo\nAfter creating the schema, run:\n```bash\nbyt schema sync --push\n```\n\nThis will copy the schema to the byteowlz/schemas repo and push it.\n\n## Reference\nSee other byteowlz repos like mmry, byt, or pipr for examples of config.schema.json files.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-24T16:35:44.809502+01:00","updated_at":"2025-12-24T16:40:48.433915+01:00","closed_at":"2025-12-24T16:40:48.433915+01:00"}

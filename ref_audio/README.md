Reference audio snippets are expected at runtime.
By default they are loaded from `~/.eaRS/ref_audio`. You can change this path
via `~/.config/eaRS/ears.toml` with a `ref_audio_dir` setting.
Provide short MP3 files named `esp.mp3`, `ger.mp3`, or `jap.mp3`. Only the first
second of each file is used for priming, so keep the clips short.
